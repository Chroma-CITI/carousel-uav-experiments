# Carousel UAV experiments
This repo holds the code that was used to lead an experimental study of UAV remote control in a congested network environment.

A serie of real-world experiment were made during december 2023, in Nantes, FRANCE. The details of the experiment setup and the results are presented in a paper named "Experimental analysis of Wi-Fi-based remote
control of UAVs with concurrent mission traffic".
